# Long Form Résumé Details

## Machine Learning Engineering (formerly Software Engineering)
**Eugene Wolfson - (Remote) United States of America**

_I’ve been immersed in Machine Learning and Data over at Meetup
for over half a decade. Mostly Python and Scala and AWS. Prior to
that, I spent half a decade at MLB Advanced Media doing all sorts
of backend software engineering in the live streaming media space.
This is the company that became Disney+. Mostly Java and AWS
with a good chunk of Python at the end as I transitioned into data.
And before that I spent a couple of years at an e-commerce startup
called OpenSky. Mostly doing backend engineering in Java and
PHP and deep diving into how startups work. My higher education
concluded with an Java software internship at a beautiful non-profit
called Trace Foundation. I completed a Masters of Arts in Computer
Science and a Bachelors of Science in Physics, Mathematics, and
Computer Science over the course of half a decade at Brandeis._

#### Staff Machine Learning Engineer with Meetup
_2018 - 2024_

Meetup is about making Babies, Bands, and Businesses.

##### Summary of my experience at Meetup:

I worked on the data team, making team contributions to the Machine Learning
Engineering, Data Engineering, and Data Science aspects of the team. As well
as providing ad-hoc assistance to critical infrastructure and backend problems
of the company at large.

##### Introduction:

It's been over half of a glorious decade of contributing to Meetup's data
team. Everything from Machine Learning Engineering, to Data Engineering,
to Data Science. A lot of Spark, AWS, Jupyter Notebooks, Python, Scala,
experimentation, SQL analysis, and recommender systems. With very little
focus on the Business Intelligence (Looker) reporting side though.
My career focus here has always been on training ever-better machine
learning models. But that's just the pearl inside the oyster at the bottom of
the data lake. Prior to being able to model anything in a company as small
as Meetup, we need to build, maintain, and operate all the systems that get
us the data. And then do the same for all the systems that serve out the
recommendations at scale.
For context, the data team's systems are mostly devoted to generating
recommendations and business intelligence. We also maintain a simple
experiment assignment service called variant that all clients invoke for running
split tests across the company.
But the vast majority of the data team's endpoints are thin layers for serving
out our recommendations. These are exposed as a collection of data APIs.
They serve our recommendations out mostly over HTTP or in a few cases
through SQS. The recommendations are generated from models, both trained/
personalized and not.
The data for these recommendations and for our business intelligence
comes from our S3-backed data lake. The lake is managed by an AWS
MWAA (Airflow) instance which schedules a variety of ETL jobs. They extract
data into S3 from various sources, such as MySQL and transforms it using
Spark (EMR). Slicing and dicing it to ultimately land into either RedShift for
reporting / analytics or into S3/DynamoDB/ElasticSearch for recommendations.
Depending on the many use-cases our clients have.

##### Details of my experience:

- This includes everything from client tracking, experiment design, S3/RedShift
data lake, various approaches to ETL, Kinesis/SQS/SNS streaming, Airflow
DAGs, and the many Spark jobs for getting this to work efficiently at scale.
- At this point, we have a data lake chock full of of rich information about
humanity's interests to wade into. This is where Data Science and Machine
Learning techniques are applied to figure out what we can do to improve the
business objectives.
- Ultimately those processes lead to loading the results into a variety of
databases like RedShift (for analysis) and DynamoDB or even Open/
ElasticSearch for request-time recommendations or SQS/SNS for
asynchronous delivery.
- And finally the recommendations are served out of a dozen or two serverless
APIs. Which do the business logic needed by each use-case/client. Note that
not everything is serverless. A bit separate, but related to all this is a cluster of
large stateful servers (ECS) for making real-time recommendations. As well a
stateless one (also ECS) for experiment assignment and tracking.
- And that's just the current state of things. Not to mention the kaleidoscope
of various infrastructure migrations and devops tooling innovations that are
involved in modernizing a 20+ year old technology company's data tech stack
for modern machine learning. Let's just say there was more than one cloud,
CI/CD wasn't ever a given, and the team transitioned from preferring bespoke
Scala tools to off-the-shelf Python libraries as the field matured...
- It's worth noting that Meetup has been a unique work opportunity because of
the timing of my tenure. The company went through several concentrated 
"bus factor" turnover events. One was associated with a WeWork fire-sale, 
another was related to a global pandemic, and the current one is the outcome
of an acquisition. I was uniquely lucky to be able to help the data team 
during all three of these transitions. Leading team-wide
documentation, cross-pollination, and training efforts. As the team turned over
with fresh (but just as lovely) faces, this allowed for a smooth offboarding and
onboarding of everyone on the team. If you'll permit an analogy: done right, the
Ship of Theseus can very much remain the same ship even after every board
has been swapped out.
- Finally, while I am firmly in the data field these days, I also inevitably
moonlight across team boundaries. Not just to make friends but also to solve
problems on the traditional engineering side of the fence. Leveraging my
previous career experience in web / backend / infrastructure / streaming
engineering, I provide architectural design suggestions, implement cost
savings, or resolve production issues for the engineering team at large. This is,
of course, an informal, ad-hoc, and rewarding process.

#### Senior Software Engineer with MLB Advanced Media in NYC, NY
_2013 - 2018_

_Summary_: Enterprise software engineering, with a focus on Java, multimedia, and
conversational interfaces. This is the company that eventually became Disney+.

* Platform for natural language interfaces (a.k.a. bots)
* Key Encipherment System
* Distributed real-time monitoring framework
* M3U8 tooling (HLS) and Transport Stream parser (ISO 13818-1)
* Full-stack Java web application development for "multimedia" department
* Miscellaneous SDLC improvements

__Platform for natural language interfaces (a.k.a. bots)__. A client and partner agnostic platform for creating natural language interfaces to MLBAM's existing services. Consists of the following parts: AWS Node.js and Python lambdas for the adapter layer for clients such as FaceBook Messenger, Slack, and Alexa; a Blue-Green deployment pipeline leveraging AWS ECS and docker containers, and Java 9 microservice containers built with Dagger2, Spark, Retrofit2, cukes-rest, junit/mockito, and lots of love and domain knowledge. These microservices are: an orchestration microservice to provide a consistent API for clients; a conversation understanding service integrating with wit.ai, and to hold conversational memory; a facade to integrate with the rest of BAM's backend service APIs; and a conversation analytics ledgering framework, backed by AWS' Firehose and S3 for anonymized analysis.

__Key Encipherment System__. A Java client that leverages AWS' DynamoDB and KMS services to provide a base level of protection for data at rest in an untrusted facility. In addition to providing a simple approach to storing encryption keys for our media, this project was also used as a real-world example for an internal talk underlining the value of designing multiple-region support into applications and services.

__Distributed real-time monitoring framework__. Some of the (snippet-sized) lessons learned on this project are available at <http://yegeniy.github.io/archived-blog>. Independent contributor to a distributed real-time monitoring system that collects data from various sources and adapts the aggregate into meaningful views for clients. Core Java libraries, Jersey (JAX-RS) with embedded Grizzly Server, Jackson for JSON, providing simple REST HTTP API to internal modules and external consumers. Long-lived TCP Socket communication and Protobuf messaging proof-of-concepts implemented. Features a sprinkling of compile-time code generation via Annotation Processing to reduce the burden of repetitive boilerplate code. The modules generally run under Tanuki’s Java Service Wrapper, but a branch for deploying to servlet containers exists.

__M3U8 tooling (HLS) and Transport Stream parser (ISO 13818-1)__. Built in "low-level" style Java, mainly to become familiar with the specifications; however, it has turned out useful enough as a personal debugging tool to solve questions from co-workers occasionally.

__Full-stack Java web application development for "multimedia" department__. Previous role was full-stack Java web application development for MLBAM and its partners as a member of the "multimedia development" (10 people) and "multimedia framework" (5 people) teams. Work includes development, design, and upgrades of most of the team’s applications; automating testing at unit, functional, integration, and load levels; writing and organizing documentation; and above all working with, learning from, and mentoring co-workers (teammates, sysadmins, DBAs, and members of other teams). Participate in technical phone screens and interviews of candidates when given the opportunity.

__Miscellaneous Software Development Life Cycle improvements__. Spend downtime, when helpful, on finding and automating away sources of friction in the development lifecycle; always making sure to document information for others within and outside the team. Examples range from: necessary one-offs such as setting up CentOS user acceptance and test environments; to long-term iterative improvements such as improving the deployment workflow as new tools become available internally (various AWS services, Blue-Green deployments, Jenkins, internal frameworks, RunDeck); to quick returns-on-investment such as facilitating conversations among people who should talk or automating away persistence-layer operational overhead with simple bash scripts (CouchBase, MySQL); to occasional long-shots such as demonstrating Docker containers, chat rooms, git, or BDD.

## Personal

Raising a wonderful girl and boy! Early in my career, I implemented a personal GTD and Deep Work organization system variant to stay focused. Leveraged kimono labs and beautifulsoup4 to collect procyclingstats.com and espn.com data for academic research on teams. Learned bioinformatics by struggling through rosalind.info/problems; attended GenSpace’s Biohacker Boot Camp. One day, I'll finally pivot back into scientific programming. But in the meantime, I go on long walks, try to be handy around the house, and encourage friends who are learning programming and machine learning.

My recent reading list has been focused on Deep Learning and Generative AI literature and content. Basically it's all side projects, online courses, and the 2025 AI Engineer Reading List these days. But back in my software engineering career, I was keeping a proper reading list: _Building Microservices_, _Smarter Faster Better_ and _Clean Code_. The previous year: finished _Data and Goliath_, _The Inmates are Running the Asylum_, _The Power of Habit_, _Scala for the Impatient_, _How to Lie with Statistics_, _Liars and Outliers_, _Antifragile_, _Java Concurrency In Practice_, _Effective Java 2nd Edition_, _Magic of Thinking Big_; and I stopped reading _The House, in Which..._ (Russian) and _The Well Grounded Java Developer_. The previous year: finished _Effective Java 2nd Edition_, _The Four Steps to the Epiphany_, _Principles_ (by Ray Dalio), and _The Innovator’s Prescription_; and stopped reading _Clean Code_, _xUnit Test Patterns_, _Fundamentals of Biostatistics_ (by Rosner), and _Pro Puppet_.

Fluent in English and Russian, with basic proficiency in French. Taught high schoolers in an after school program called Russian School of Mathematics after work and on the weekends in 2017. Mentored children with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a Counselor for the Children of Sderot Camp in Israel in the Summer of 2009.

Way back in college, revived and became the president of Brandeis Physics Club from Fall 2007 until Spring 2010. Fostered interest in the sciences through local community outreach. Led three small groups in design and building of project for the Bernstein Festival of the Creative Arts. Wrote proposals to receive club funding from various on-campus sources.
