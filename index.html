<p><strong>Eugene Wolfson - (Remote) United States of
America</strong></p>
<p><em>I’ve been immersed in Machine Learning and Data over at Meetup
for over half a decade. Mostly Python and Scala and AWS. Prior to that,
I spent half a decade at MLB Advanced Media doing all sorts of backend
software engineering in the live streaming media space. This is the
company that became Disney+. Mostly Java and AWS with a good chunk of
Python at the end as I transitioned into data. And before that I spent a
couple of years at an e-commerce startup called OpenSky. Mostly doing
backend engineering in Java and PHP and deep diving into how startups
work. My higher education concluded with an Java software internship at
a beautiful non-profit called Trace Foundation. I completed a Masters of
Arts in Computer Science and a Bachelors of Science in Physics,
Mathematics, and Computer Science over the course of half a decade at
Brandeis.</em></p>

<p>I worked on the data team, making team contributions to the Machine
Learning Engineering, Data Engineering, and Data Science aspects of the
team. As well as providing ad-hoc assistance to critical infrastructure
and backend problems of the company at large.</p>
<h5 id="introduction">Introduction:</h5>
<p>It's been over half of a glorious decade of contributing to Meetup's
data team. Everything from Machine Learning Engineering, to Data
Engineering, to Data Science. A lot of Spark, AWS, Jupyter Notebooks,
Python, Scala, experimentation, SQL analysis, and recommender systems.
With very little focus on the Business Intelligence (Looker) reporting
side though. My career focus here has always been on training
ever-better machine learning models. But that's just the pearl inside
the oyster at the bottom of the data lake. Prior to being able to model
anything in a company as small as Meetup, we need to build, maintain,
and operate all the systems that get us the data. And then do the same
for all the systems that serve out the recommendations at scale. For
context, the data team's systems are mostly devoted to generating
recommendations and business intelligence. We also maintain a simple
experiment assignment service called variant that all clients invoke for
running split tests across the company. But the vast majority of the
data team's endpoints are thin layers for serving out our
recommendations. These are exposed as a collection of data APIs. They
serve our recommendations out mostly over HTTP or in a few cases through
SQS. The recommendations are generated from models, both trained/
personalized and not. The data for these recommendations and for our
business intelligence comes from our S3-backed data lake. The lake is
managed by an AWS MWAA (Airflow) instance which schedules a variety of
ETL jobs. They extract data into S3 from various sources, such as MySQL
and transforms it using Spark (EMR). Slicing and dicing it to ultimately
land into either RedShift for reporting / analytics or into
S3/DynamoDB/ElasticSearch for recommendations. Depending on the many
use-cases our clients have.</p>
<h5 id="details-of-my-experience">Details of my experience:</h5>
<ul>
<li>This includes everything from client tracking, experiment design,
S3/RedShift data lake, various approaches to ETL, Kinesis/SQS/SNS
streaming, Airflow DAGs, and the many Spark jobs for getting this to
work efficiently at scale.</li>
<li>At this point, we have a data lake chock full of of rich information
about humanity's interests to wade into. This is where Data Science and
Machine Learning techniques are applied to figure out what we can do to
improve the business objectives.</li>
<li>Ultimately those processes lead to loading the results into a
variety of databases like RedShift (for analysis) and DynamoDB or even
Open/ ElasticSearch for request-time recommendations or SQS/SNS for
asynchronous delivery.</li>
<li>And finally the recommendations are served out of a dozen or two
serverless APIs. Which do the business logic needed by each
use-case/client. Note that not everything is serverless. A bit separate,
but related to all this is a cluster of large stateful servers (ECS) for
making real-time recommendations. As well a stateless one (also ECS) for
experiment assignment and tracking.</li>
<li>And that's just the current state of things. Not to mention the
kaleidoscope of various infrastructure migrations and devops tooling
innovations that are involved in modernizing a 20+ year old technology
company's data tech stack for modern machine learning. Let's just say
there was more than one cloud, CI/CD wasn't ever a given, and the team
transitioned from preferring bespoke Scala tools to off-the-shelf Python
libraries as the field matured...</li>
<li>It's worth noting that Meetup has been a unique work opportunity
because of the timing of my tenure. The company went through several
concentrated "bus factor" turnover events. One was associated with a
WeWork fire-sale, another was related to a global pandemic, and the
current one is the outcome of an acquisition. I was uniquely lucky to be
able to help the data team during all three of these transitions.
Leading team-wide documentation, cross-pollination, and training
efforts. As the team turned over with fresh (but just as lovely) faces,
this allowed for a smooth offboarding and onboarding of everyone on the
team. If you'll permit an analogy: done right, the Ship of Theseus can
very much remain the same ship even after every board has been swapped
out.</li>
<li>Finally, while I am firmly in the data field these days, I also
inevitably moonlight across team boundaries. Not just to make friends
but also to solve problems on the traditional engineering side of the
fence. Leveraging my previous career experience in web / backend /
infrastructure / streaming engineering, I provide architectural design
suggestions, implement cost savings, or resolve production issues for
the engineering team at large. This is, of course, an informal, ad-hoc,
and rewarding process.</li>

Software Engineer with MLB Advanced Media in NYC, NY</h4>
<p><em>2013 - 2018</em></p>
<p><em>Summary</em>: Enterprise software engineering, with a focus on
Java, multimedia, and conversational interfaces. This is the company
that eventually became Disney+.</p>
<ul>
<li>Platform for natural language interfaces (a.k.a. bots)</li>
<li>Key Encipherment System</li>
<li>Distributed real-time monitoring framework</li>
<li>M3U8 tooling (HLS) and Transport Stream parser (ISO 13818-1)</li>
<li>Full-stack Java web application development for "multimedia"
department</li>
<li>Miscellaneous SDLC improvements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Platform for natural language interfaces (a.k.a.
bots)</strong>. A client and partner agnostic platform for creating
natural language interfaces to MLBAM's existing services. Consists of
the following parts: AWS Node.js and Python lambdas for the adapter
layer for clients such as FaceBook Messenger, Slack, and Alexa; a
Blue-Green deployment pipeline leveraging AWS ECS and docker containers,
and Java 9 microservice containers built with Dagger2, Spark, Retrofit2,
cukes-rest, junit/mockito, and lots of love and domain knowledge. These
microservices are: an orchestration microservice to provide a consistent
API for clients; a conversation understanding service integrating with
wit.ai, and to hold conversational memory; a facade to integrate with
the rest of BAM's backend service APIs; and a conversation analytics
ledgering framework, backed by AWS' Firehose and S3 for anonymized
analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Key Encipherment System</strong>. A Java client that
leverages AWS' DynamoDB and KMS services to provide a base level of
protection for data at rest in an untrusted facility. In addition to
providing a simple approach to storing encryption keys for our media,
this project was also used as a real-world example for an internal talk
underlining the value of designing multiple-region support into
applications and services.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed real-time monitoring framework</strong>. Some of
the (snippet-sized) lessons learned on this project are available at <a
href="http://yegeniy.github.io/archived-blog">http://yegeniy.github.io/archived-blog</a>.
Independent contributor to a distributed real-time monitoring system
that collects data from various sources and adapts the aggregate into
meaningful views for clients. Core Java libraries, Jersey (JAX-RS) with
embedded Grizzly Server, Jackson for JSON, providing simple REST HTTP
API to internal modules and external consumers. Long-lived TCP Socket
communication and Protobuf messaging proof-of-concepts implemented.
Features a sprinkling of compile-time code generation via Annotation
Processing to reduce the burden of repetitive boilerplate code. The
modules generally run under Tanuki’s Java Service Wrapper, but a branch
for deploying to servlet containers exists.</p>
<p><strong>M3U8 tooling (HLS) and Transport Stream parser (ISO
13818-1)</strong>. Built in "low-level" style Java, mainly to become
familiar with the specifications; however, it has turned out useful
enough as a personal debugging tool to solve questions from co-workers
occasionally.</p>
<p><strong>Full-stack Java web application development for "multimedia"
department</strong>. Previous role was full-stack Java web application
development for MLBAM and its partners as a member of the "multimedia
development" (10 people) and "multimedia framework" (5 people) teams.
Work includes development, design, and upgrades of most of the team’s
applications; automating testing at unit, functional, integration, and
load levels; writing and organizing documentation; and above all working
with, learning from, and mentoring co-workers (teammates, sysadmins,
DBAs, and members of other teams). Participate in technical phone
screens and interviews of candidates when given the opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Software Development Life Cycle
improvements</strong>. Spend downtime, when helpful, on finding and
automating away sources of friction in the development lifecycle; always
making sure to document information for others within and outside the
team. Examples range from: necessary one-offs such as setting up CentOS
user acceptance and test environments; to long-term iterative
improvements such as improving the deployment workflow as new tools
become available internally (various AWS services, Blue-Green
deployments, Jenkins, internal frameworks, RunDeck); to quick
returns-on-investment such as facilitating conversations among people
who should talk or automating away persistence-layer operational
overhead with simple bash scripts (CouchBase, MySQL); to occasional
long-shots such as demonstrating Docker containers, chat rooms, git, or
BDD.</p>

<p>Raising a wonderful girl and boy! Early in my career, I implemented a
personal GTD and Deep Work organization system variant to stay focused.
Leveraged kimono labs and beautifulsoup4 to collect procyclingstats.com
and espn.com data for academic research on teams. Learned bioinformatics
by struggling through rosalind.info/problems; attended GenSpace’s
Biohacker Boot Camp. One day, I'll finally pivot back into scientific
programming. But in the meantime, I go on long walks, try to be handy
around the house, and encourage friends who are learning programming and
machine learning.</p>
<p>My recent reading list has been focused on Deep Learning and
Generative AI literature and content. Basically it's all side projects,
online courses, and the 2025 AI Engineer Reading List these days. But
back in my software engineering career, I was keeping a proper reading
list: <em>Building Microservices</em>, <em>Smarter Faster Better</em>
and <em>Clean Code</em>. The previous year: finished <em>Data and
Goliath</em>, <em>The Inmates are Running the Asylum</em>, <em>The Power
of Habit</em>, <em>Scala for the Impatient</em>, <em>How to Lie with
Statistics</em>, <em>Liars and Outliers</em>, <em>Antifragile</em>,
<em>Java Concurrency In Practice</em>, <em>Effective Java 2nd
Edition</em>, <em>Magic of Thinking Big</em>; and I stopped reading
<em>The House, in Which...</em> (Russian) and <em>The Well Grounded Java
Developer</em>. The previous year: finished <em>Effective Java 2nd
Edition</em>, <em>The Four Steps to the Epiphany</em>,
<em>Principles</em> (by Ray Dalio), and <em>The Innovator’s
Prescription</em>; and stopped reading <em>Clean Code</em>, <em>xUnit
Test Patterns</em>, <em>Fundamentals of Biostatistics</em> (by Rosner),
and <em>Pro Puppet</em>.</p>
<p>Fluent in English and Russian, with basic proficiency in French.
Taught high schoolers in an after school program called Russian School
of Mathematics after work and on the weekends in 2017. Mentored children
with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a Counselor for the Children of
Sderot Camp in Israel in the Summer of 2009.</p>
<p>Way back in college, revived and became the president of Brandeis
Physics Club from Fall 2007 until Spring 2010. Fostered interest in the
sciences through local community outreach. Led three small groups in
design and building of project for the Bernstein Festival of the
Creative Arts. Wrote proposals to receive club funding from various
on-campus sources.</p>
